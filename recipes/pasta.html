    <p>Give this indulgent pasta dish more of an Italian flair by using prosciutto or pancetta instead of bacon</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces uncooked dried fettuccine</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped bacon (about 9 oz.)</li>
        <li>2 pints multicolored cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 shallots, thinly sliced (about ½ cup)</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated (about ½ cup), plus more for serving</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook pasta in salted water according to package directions. Drain, reserving 1 ½ cups cooking water.</li>
        <li>While pasta cooks, cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high until crisp, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer bacon to a plate lined with paper towels to drain; reserve 2 tablespoons drippings in skillet.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes to skillet, and cook, stirring often, until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Add shallots, and cook, stirring often, until shallots and tomatoes are softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic; cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Add 1 cup of the reserved cooking water; bring to boil. Remove from heat, and stir in pasta. Stir in egg yolks, 1 at a time, until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Return skillet to medium-low, and cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is slightly thickened and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in bacon, cheese, chives, parsley, and pepper until cheese melts and sauce is smooth, adding remaining ½ cup cooking water if necessary to reach desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Top servings evenly with grated Parmesan.</li>
        <strong>Enjoy!</strong>
